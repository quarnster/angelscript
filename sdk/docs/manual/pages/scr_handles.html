<h1>Object handles</h1>

<p>An object handle is a type that can hold a reference to an object. With
object handles it is possible to declare more than one variables that refer
to the same physical object.</p>

<p>Not all types allow object handles to be used. None of the primitive
data types, bool, int, float, etc, can have object handles. Object types
registered by the application may or may not allow object handles, verify
the applications documentation.
</p>

<p>An object handle is declared by appending the @ symbol to the data type.</p>

<pre class=border>
object@ obj_h;
</pre>

<p>This code declares the object handle obj and initializes it to null, i.e.
it doesn't hold a reference to any object.</p>

<p>In expressions variables declared as object handles are used the exact 
same way as normal objects. But you should be aware that object handles are
not guaranteed to actually reference an object, and if you try to access the
contents of an object in a handle that is null an exception will be raised.</p>

<pre class=border>
object obj;
object@ obj_h;
obj.Method();
obj_h.Method();
</pre>

<p>Operators like =, or any other operator registered for the object type work
on the actual object that the handle references. These will also throw an 
exception if the handle is empty.</p>

<pre class=border>
object obj;
object@ obj_h;
obj_h = obj;
</pre>

<p>When you need to make an operation on the actual handle, you should prepend
the expression with the @ symbol. Setting the object handle to point to an 
object is for example done like this:</p>

<pre class=border>
object obj;
object@ obj_h;
@obj_h = @obj;
</pre>

<p>An object handle can be compared against another object handle 
(of the same type) to verify if they are pointing to the same object or not. 
It can also be compared against null, which is a special keyword that 
represents an empty handle.</p>

<pre class=border>
object@ obj_a, obj_b;
<font color=blue>if</font>( @obj_a == @obj_b ) {}
<font color=blue>if</font>( @obj_a == null ) {}
</pre>

<p>An object's life time is normally for the duration of the scope the 
variable was declared in. But if a handle outside the scope is set to 
reference the object, the object will live on until all object handles are
released.</p>

<pre class=border>
object@ obj_h;
{
  object obj;
  @obj_h = @obj;
  
  <font color=green>// The object would normally die when the block ends, 
  // but the handle is still holding a reference to it</font>
}

<font color=green>// The object still lives on in obj_h ...</font>
obj_h.Method();

<font color=green>// ... until the reference is explicitly released 
// or the object handle goes out of scope</font>
@obj_h = null;
</pre>
