<h1>Documentation: Good practices</h1>

<p>This article will try to explain some good practices, that will help you get going faster and easier find the solution when a problem occurs.</p>

<h2>Always check return values for registrations</h2>

<p>
When configuring the script engine you should always check the return values, at least in debug mode. All error codes are negative so a simple assert( r >= 0 ) where r is the returned value is sufficient to pinpoint where the configuration failed.
</p>

<p>If a function failed during the configuration, the Build() method will always fail with a return code of asINVALID_CONFIGURATION. And unless you already verified the error codes for all the configuration calls, it will not be possible to determine what the error was.</p>

<pre class=border>
<font color=green>// Verifying the return code with an assert is simple and won't pollute the code</font>
r = engine->RegisterGlobalFunction("void func()", asFUNCTION(func), asCALL_CDECL); assert( r >= 0 );
</pre>

<p>assert() can safely be used with engine registrations, since the engine will set the internal state to invalid configuration if a function fails. Even in release mode the failure is discovered when a script is built.</p>

<h2>Use the output stream to receive detailed error messages</h2>

<p>
The return code from the register functions, Build(), and ExecuteString() can 
only tell you that something was wrong, not what it was. To help identify the 
exact problem the output stream should be used. The script library will then 
send messages explaining the error or warning in clear text.
</p>

<p>
For your convenience the library has been designed so that when there are no 
errors or warnings, nothing will be output to the stream.
</p>

<pre class=border>
<font color=green>// Declare a simple output stream class</font>
class COutStream : public asIOutputStream
{
public:
  void Write(const char *text) { printf(text); }
};

<font color=green>// Set the output stream pointer when creating the engine</font>
COutStream out;
asIScriptEngine *engine = asCreateScriptEngine(ANGELSCRIPT_VERSION);
engine->SetCommonMessageStream(&amp;out);
</pre>

<p>Don't forget to make sure the output stream is valid during the entire life time of the script engine, or call SetCommonMessageStream() with 0 to remove the stream again.</p>
