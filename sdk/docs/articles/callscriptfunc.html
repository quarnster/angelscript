<h1>Calling script functions with parameters</h1>

<p>2004/12/01, Andreas Jönsson</p>

<p>Generally speaking the script functions use the same calling convention as 
global C functions, i.e. the parameters are pushed on the stack in reverse 
order and the return value is returned in a register, unless it is an object 
in which case it is returned in memory allocated by the calling function.</p>

<h2>Preparing context and executing the function</h2>

<p>Normally a script function is executed in a few steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prepare the context
<li>Set the function arguments
<li>Execute the function
<li>Retrieve the return value
</ol>

<p>This is assuming a script context is already available. The code for this 
might look something like this:</p>

<pre class=border>
<font color=green>// Prepare() must be called to allow the context to prepare the stack</font>
context->Prepare(engine->GetFunctionIDByDecl(module_name, function_declaration);

<font color=green>// SetArguments() is used to push the arguments on the stack</font>
context->SetArguments(...);

int r = context->Execute();
if( r == asEXECUTION_FINISHED )
{
  <font color=green>// The return value is only valid if the execution finished successfully</font>
  context->GetReturnValue(...);
}
</pre>

<p>If your application uses ExecuteStep() or registers a function that allow 
the script to suspend its execution, then the execution function may return 
before finishing with the return code asEXECUTION_SUSPENDED. In that case you
can later resume the execution by simply calling the execution function again.
</p>

<p>Note that the return value retrieved with GetReturnValue() is only valid
if the script function returned successfully, i.e. if Execute() returned 
asEXECUTION_FINISHED.</p>

<h2>Passing and returning primitives</h2>

<p>When calling script functions that take arguments, the values of these 
arguments must be pushed on the context stack after the call to Prepare() and
before Execute(). The arguments are pushed on the stack using the method 
SetArguments():</p>

<pre class=border>
int SetArguments(int stackPos, asDWORD *data, int count);
</pre>

<p><code>stackPos</code> is the position of the argument on the stack in dwords. 
It is determined by summing the size of all previous parameters. <code>data</code> is a 
pointer to the actual data the will be pushed on the stack. <code>count</code> is the size 
in dwords of the data that should be pushed on the stack.</p>

<pre class=border>
  <font color=green>// The context has been prepared for a script 
  // function with the following signature:
  // int function(int, double, void*)

  // Put the arguments on the context stack, starting with the first one</font>
  int ival = 0;
  ctx->SetArguments(0, &amp;ival, 1);
  double dval = 0.0;
  ctx->SetArguments(1, &amp;dval, 2);
  void *pval = 0;
  ctx->SetArguments(3, &amp;pval, 1);
</pre>

<p>It would also be possible to build a buffer with all the arguments and then
copy the entire buffer in one call to SetArguments().</p>

<p>Once the script function has been executed the return value is retrieved in 
a similar way using the method GetReturnValue():</p>

<pre class=border>
int GetReturnValue(asDWORD *data, int count);
</pre>

<p><code>data</code> is a pointer to where the return value is to be copied. 
<code>count</code> is the size of the value in dwords.</p>

<p>Note that you must make sure the returned value is in fact valid, for 
example if the script function was interrupted by a script exception the value
would not be valid. You do this by verifying the return code from Execute() or
GetState(), where the return code should be asEXECUTION_FINISHED.</p>

<h2>Passing and returning objects by value</h2>

<p>AngelScript is recognizably lacking when it comes to passing objects to 
script functions, especially if the objects require special care because of 
allocated resources. Future versions will remedy this, in the meantime, here
is an explanation of how it can be done.</p>

<p>Passing a simple object like struct Vector3 { float x; float y; float z; } 
is as simple as passing a primitive, just call SetArguments() and pass the 
pointer to the object and the size of the object in dwords. </p>

<p>Passing a more complex object that allocate and free resources is a lot 
more complicated. If you try to simply copy such an object to the context 
stack, then you will be creating a duplicate. When this duplicate is later 
destroyed it might destroy resources still held by the original object 
(or vice versa). What you need is a way to move the object into the context 
stack.</p>

<pre class=border>
<font color=green>// The complex object we wish to pass to the script function</font>
CObject obj;

<font color=green>// Allocate some generic memory</font>
char *mem = new char[sizeof(CObject)];

<font color=green>// Copy construct an object into the generic memory. This
// should take care of the resources allocated by obj. 
// The placement new operator is declared in new.h.</font>
new(mem) CObject(obj);

<font color=green>// Copy the memory into the context stack.
Now the context is responsible for deleting the object.</font>
ctx->SetArguments(pos, mem, ((sizeof(CObject)+3)&amp;~3)/4);

<font color=green>// Free the memory without destroying the object</font>
delete[] mem;
</pre>

<p>This piece of code is using some C++ trickery to make a valid duplicate of 
the object. Valid in that it would also duplicate the resources, or correctly 
share them depending on how the resources are handled. This of course requires
that the class was in fact correctly implemented to support the copy 
constructor. One the duplicate has been copied into the context stack the C++
code must not delete the object, which is why we never call the object's 
destructor.</p>

<p>Getting an object returned by a script function is done in a similar way. 
It's complicated further because the C++ application must allocate the memory
for the object before calling the script function. The pointer to this memory
should be passed to the script function as the first argument, i.e. in 
position 0, and all other arguments have their position increased with 1.</p>

<pre class=border>
<font color=green>// The object where we want to store the return value</font>
CObject obj;

<font color=green>// Allocate memory for the returned object.
// Make sure no object is constructed in the memory.</font>
char *mem = new char[sizeof(CObject)];

<font color=green>// Pass the pointer as the first argument</font>
ctx->SetArguments(0, &amp;mem, 1);

<font color=green>// Execute the function</font>
int r = ctx->Execute();
if( r == asEXECUTION_FINISHED )
{
  <font color=green>// Now the memory has been initialized with the object.
  // If we called GetReturnValue() we would receive the pointer to the memory</font>
  
  <font color=green>// Copy the object to our true object</font>
  obj = *(CObject*)mem;
  
  <font color=green>// Destroy the object before freeing the memory</font>
  ((CObject*)mem)->~CObject();
}

<font color=green>// Free the memory</font>
delete[] mem;
</pre>

<p>In this piece of code it is important to note that the object is destroyed
by explicitly calling the objects destructor, before the memory is freed. If 
the object was a simple struct, then it would not be necessary to call
its destructor, but it would still be necessary to allocate the memory and 
pass the pointer as shown in the code.</p>
