<h1>Upgrade instructions for AngelScript</h1>

<p>2004/11/12, Andreas Jönsson</p>

<p>This article will help you upgrading your existing application to use the 
latest version of AngelScript. It will explain the necessary steps needed to 
make the application work, though not necessarily to take advantage of the 
new features.</p>

<h2>Version 1.9.x to 1.10.x</h2>

<h3>Application interface</h3>

<span class=a>
asIScriptEngine::RegisterObjectBehaviour() can now only register object 
behaviours, i.e. those behaviours that require an object type. The behaviours
that were registered with datatype = 0 should now be registered with 
RegisterGlobalBehaviour().<br>
<br>
NOTE: Define AS_DEPRECATED for backwards compatibility.
</span>
<span class=b>
Methods that are used to obtain a string from the engine have changed. Instead
of passing a buffer to the methods, they now use an internal buffer and then 
return a pointer to that one. The internal buffer is shared between all of 
them so the returned pointer shouldn't be stored for later use. Affected 
methods are:
<ul>
<li>asIScriptEngine::GetFunctionName()
<li>asIScriptEngine::GetFunctionDeclaration()
<li>asIScriptEngine::GetGlobalVarName()
<li>asIScriptEngine::GetGlobalVarDeclaration()
<li>asIScriptEngine::GetImportedFunctionDeclaration()
<li>asIScriptContext::GetExceptionString()
</ul>
NOTE: Define AS_DEPRECATED for backwards compatibility.
</span>
<span class=a>
asIScriptEngine::ExecuteString() has been altered to take one more parameter
receives the pointer to the context used for the execution. The new parameter
was inserted before the last parameter, and can be set to 0.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Define AS_DEPRECATED for backwards compatibility.
</span>
<span class=b>
asIScriptEngine::GetContextForExecuteString() is deprecated and should no 
longer be used. If you need the context you should pass a pointer to a 
variable to ExecuteString(). ExecuteString() will then return the context in 
that variable.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Define AS_DEPRECATED for backwards compatibility.
</span>

<h3>Project files</h3>

<span class=a>
as_compiler_expression.cpp was merged into as_compiler.cpp. 
</span>
<span class=b>
as_thread.h and as_thread.cpp were created to add support for multithreading.
</span>
<span class=a>
as_context_x86.cpp was created to add an x86 assembler optimized VM.
</span>
<span class=b>
as_arrayobject.h and as_arrayobject.cpp were created to add support for native arrays.
</span>
<span class=a>
as_debug.h was added to the code to hold code used for debugging reasons.
</span>
<span class=b>
as_typeinfo.h and as_typeinfo.cpp were added to the project.
</span>

<h2>Version 1.8.x to 1.9.x</h2>

<h3>Application interface</h3>


<span class=a>
The asIScriptEngine::RegisterTypeBehaviour() method was renamed to 
RegisterObjectBehaviour(). This was done to make the method names more 
consistent. 
</span>
<span class=b>
The flags asCALL_RETURNBYVAL and asCALL_RETURNBYREF are no longer defined and 
should be removed completely. 
</span>
<span class=a>
The flags asOBJ_IS_COMPLEX and asOBJ_IS_NOT_COMPLEX for 
asIScriptEngine::RegisterObjectType() should not be used any more. They should 
be replaced with one of the following flags: 
<ul>
<li>asOBJ_CLASS - This is a structure or a class. Combine this flag with the 
	following as needed: 
	<ul>
    <li>asOBJ_CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR - The default constructor is defined 
    <li>asOBJ_CLASS_DESTRUCTOR - The destructor is defined 
	<li>asOBJ_CLASS_ASSIGNMENT - The assignment operator is overloaded.
	</ul>
<li>asOBJ_PRIMITIVE - The datatype is really a primitive, except float or 
	double 
<li>asOBJ_FLOAT - The datatype is really a float or a double type 
</ul>
This was done because of how different compilers handles return of various
types. The identification of the real C++ was necessary to make the 
library portable between compilers and platforms. 
</span>
<span class=b>
The compiler messages have changed to use a more standardized format so if 
your application depended on the format returned you'll need to update your 
code. 
</span>
<span class=a>
The methods asIScriptContext::Prepare() and asIScriptEngine::ExecuteString()
no longer take the stack size argument. The engine has been changed so that 
the stack dynamically grows as needed which eliminates the need to set a 
hardcoded limit. If you still want to control the size of the stack, then you 
can do so through the new method 
asIScriptEngine::SetDefaultContextStackSize(). 
</span>
<span class=b>
The define AS_CALL was removed from the interface. Simply do a search and
remove all use of this define. This also changes the exported symbol names for 
the global functions. Where they previously followed the naming convention for 
stdcall, they now use the cdecl naming convention. 
</span>
<span class=a>
asIScriptEngine::GetModuleID() no longer exists. You could instead use the 
new method asIScriptEngine::GetModuleIndex() and shift the value 16 bits to 
the left. If you were using it for enumerating functions you can now use the 
new method asIScriptEngine::GetFunctionIDByIndex() instead. 
</span>
<span class=b>
asIScriptEngine::AddScriptSection() now takes an extra parameter to allow 
adjustment of the line numbers in compiler and exception messages. Simply add 
0 as a last argument to the call. 
</span>


<h3>Project files</h3>

<span class=a>
as_restore.cpp and as_restore.h was added to the library project. 
</span>
<span class=b>
The source files ac_string.cpp, ac_string.h, and ac_array.h were renamed 
to as_string.cpp, as_string.h and as_array.h respectively. 
</span>

<h2>Version 1.7.x to 1.8.x</h2>

<h3>Application interface</h3>

<span class=a>
asIScriptEngine::RegisterGlobalProperty() and 
asIScriptEngine::RegisterObjectProperty() no longer take the flags parameter. 
If the property should be read only, add const to the declaration. 
</span>
<span class=b>
The bstr type was removed from the library to allow the application to use 
other string objects. The old bstr type can be registered externally using 
the new asIScriptEngine::RegisterScriptFactory() method. There is an add-on 
code available that does all this for you with a simple call to a function. 
</span>
<span class=a>
The functions asBStrAlloc(), asBStrFree(), and asBStrLength() are no longer 
exported by the library. 
</span>
<span class=b>
The asMETHOD() macro has been improved. It now takes two arguments, the class 
name and the method name, instead of both of them together. Where you 
previously wrote <code>asMETHOD(CMyClass::Method)</code> you should now write 
<code>asMETHOD(CMyClass, Method)</code>. There are also variants of macro 
available that help in registering overloaded methods and functions. 
</span>
<span class=a>
The internal script functions @init() and @exit() are no longer reported by 
asIScriptEngine::GetFunctionCount(), 
asIScriptEngine::GetFunctionDeclaration(), etc. These where previously 
reported as the first two functions when enumerating the script functions. If 
you were doing something to skip these you'll have to revise that code. 
</span>
<span class=b>
asIScriptEngine::RegisterObjectType() should now use the flags 
asOBJ_IS_COMPLEX, and asOBJ_IS_NOT_COMPLEX.<br>
<br>
NOTE: These flags were replaced with another set of flags for version 1.9.x.
</span>
<span class=a>
With version 1.8.0 the support for separate modules was added, which meant 
that many functions needed an extra parameter for naming the module. The 
simplest upgrade is to add the argument 0 first to all calls to the following 
methods: 
<ul>
<li>asIScriptEngine::AddScriptSection() 
<li>asIScriptEngine::Build() 
<li>asIScriptEngine::GetFunctionCount() 
<li>asIScriptEngine::GetFunctionIDByName() 
<li>asIScriptEngine::GetFunctionIDByDecl() 
<li>asIScriptEngine::ExecuteString() 
</ul>
</span>

<h3>Script language</h3>

<span class=a>
There is no longer a standard string type for the language. The application is 
allowed to register the string type as it desires. There is existing code for 
registering the bstr type for backwards compatibility. 
</span>

<h3>Project files</h3>

<span class=a>
A new source module was added to the project. You'll need to add as_module.cpp
and as_module.h to you compilation. 
</span>
<span class=b>
The source module as_callfunc.cpp was renamed to as_callfunc_x86.cpp. 
</span>
<span class=a>
The files were changed to include 
angelscript.h from the include directory instead of from the source directory. 
</span>


<h2>Version 1.6.x to 1.7.x</h2>

<h3>Application interface</h3>


<span class=a>
The method asIScriptEngine::RegisterObjectType() now accepts the flags 
asCALL_RETURNBYREF and asCALL_RETURNBYVAL, which makes it unnecessary to pass 
these flags to the the various methods for registering functions and methods.
<br>
<br>
NOTE: These flags have changed again in version 1.8.x and 1.9.x.
</span>
<span class=b>
The method asIScriptEngine::ExecuteStep() now takes a flag that can be used to 
control the execution even further. You can set it to 0 to maintain the same 
behaviour as before. 
</span>

<h3>Script language</h3>

<span class=a>
The bstr.length property has become a method in order to better conform with 
the rest of the library.<br>
<br>
NOTE: In version 1.8.x you can register own string type.
</span>
