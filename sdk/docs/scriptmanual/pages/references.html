<h1>References</h1>

<p>
Passing variables by references to and from functions allow for increased
flexibility in the way you solve a problem. A function can normally only 
return one value, but by declaring the function to take a parameter by 
reference the function can use that reference to set a second return value.
</p>

<p>A parameter is declared as reference by appending the symbol &amp; followed 
by <code>in</code>, <code>out</code>, or <code>inout</code>. The word 
following the &amp; symbol shows in which direction the value in the 
reference is passed, in to the function, out from function, or both.</p>

<pre>
<font color=blue>void</font> function(<font color=blue>int</font> &amp;<font color=blue>in</font> a, <font color=blue>int</font> &amp;<font color=blue>out</font> b)
{
  <font color=green>// The value of b will be returned to the calling function</font>
  b = a;
  
  <font color=green>// The value of a is not returned to the calling function</font>
  a = 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
The term by reference, might be a bit misgiving, as it is not a reference to
the actual value that is being passed to the function, but rather a reference
to a value of the same type. If the reference is <code>in</code> or 
<code>inout</code> the value will have the same value as the expression 
calculated for the argument, otherwise it will be unitialized. If the 
reference is <code>out</code> or <code>inout</code> the value in the parameter
will be copied back to the original variable when the function returns.
</p>

<p>
When the reference is <code>in</code> the argument expression is evaluated 
before the function call, and for <code>out</code> the expression is evaluated
after the function returns. For <code>inout</code> the expression is evaluated
twice, so be aware of this when using complex expressions for the function
arguments.
</p>

<p>As you might have guessed, it is not very useful to declare a parameter as
&amp;in because the value will be copied anyway. The only reason that this 
option is available is that some application functions might require it.</p>

<p>If possible, it is normally better to pass the objects using a handle 
instead of passing it by reference, because this will avoid a potentially
expensive copy of the object.</p>
