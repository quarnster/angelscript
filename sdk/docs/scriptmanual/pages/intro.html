<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The syntax for AngelScript is very similar to that of C or other languages
derived from it, such as C++, Java, Javascript or C#. If you are already
familiar with any of these languages you should have no problem understanding
the syntax of AngelScript.</p>

<h2>Extendible</h2>

<p>As AngelScript was created to be an easy way to modify applications from
outside the executable the language has the basic syntax and operators
described in this manual. But the language can also be extended by the host
application to include new data types and built in functions. You should read
the manual for the application to know what extensions it brings.</p>

<h2>Not type less</h2>

<p>AngelScript is not a type less language, as so many other scripting languages
are. This design was chosen so that AngelScript can more efficiently communicate
with the host application that it is extending.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Comments can be placed anywhere in the script code where whitespaces are
allowed. There are two types of comments available, the one line comment that
starts with a double slash (<code><font color=green>//</font></code>) and ends with a line break, and
the multiple lines comment that starts with a slash and a star (<code><font color=green>/*</font></code>)
and ends with a star and a slash (<code><font color=green>*/</font></code>). Comments can't be nested
as the compiler doesn't interpret characters between the starting and ending
tokens.
